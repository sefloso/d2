I treasure these songs. I'm always like, y'know, part of the fun dynamic of writing an album is thinking, oh Wurster will be able to chew this one up, or whatever. The ones I feel Peter will connect to and feel like I actually dug a little and found a, y'know, Peter has an ear for what I call fine feeling, where it's not spelling it out, it's rendering something, like a pastel or watercolor and then you have to sort of look at it long enough to get what's going on. I feel like that's sort of Peter's zone, right? This is my read on you. Uh, you know, like the go-betweens, like not spelling it out planely. Speaking planely, but not spelling it out planely, right? So, this is one of those, right? And plus, Peter had like this amazing experience with an aquarium once in Australia where he went for a walk really tired and stood before some fish and like got really emotional. And you, we've all been there. I was thinking that as I was writing it. And so, when he got the demos, he went, oh I really like this song, and I was pleased. And we tracked it, I was actually had my doubts, because it's so even, I don't yell or anything and I'm always worried about the ones where I don't raise my voice much. But then it came out so nice and I was like, ah, this is gonna be great live. But then the plague happened, you know, and then we didn't get to go play it live, so that was really great. That's the end of that story\nWe're the Mountain Goats and this next song is called \"Picture of My Dress\"Embed"
